## Levels and Layers in Linux 🏴‍☠️

### ✔ Hardware: Level 1

The hardware is at the base, include the memory to perform computation. (CPU, RAM, disk, network, etc.)

### ✔ Kernel: Level 2

It is responsible for managing the hardware and providing an interface for the user to interact with the hardware. (system calls, process management, memory management, device drivers, etc.)

### ✔ User Process: Level 3 

The running programs managed by the kernel. (graphical user interface, servers, shell, etc.)

## Hardware: Main Memory 🏴‍☠️

The main memory is the place where the data and instructions are stored. An slot in the memory is called a byte. The memory is organized in a way that each byte has a unique address. The address is a number that identifies the byte.

## Kernel 🏴‍☠️

- Process: Determine the process allowed to access the memory.
- Memory: Determine the memory allowed to be accessed by the process.
- Driver: The kernel acts as interface between the hardware and the user process.

### ✔ Process Management

- Starting a process: The kernel creates a new process and allocates memory for it.
- Pausing a process: The kernel suspends the process and saves its state.
- Resuming a process: The kernel restores the process state and resumes it.
- Scheduling: The kernel decides which process to run next.
- Terminating a process: The kernel terminates the process and frees its memory.

Note: Many processes can be running simultaneously but only one process can be running at a time.

### ✔ Memory Management

- Allocating memory: The kernel allocates memory for a process.
- Freeing memory: The kernel frees memory allocated for a process.
- Swapping: The kernel moves a process from memory to disk and vice versa.

### ✔ Device Drivers 

Allowing the user process to interact with a hardware device.

### ✔ System Calls

Interaction between the user process and the kernel.

- Fork: Create a new process.
- Exec: Start a new program.
- Wait: Wait for a child process to terminate.
- Exit: Terminate a process.
- Kill: Terminate a process.
- Init: Start the init process.

## User Space 🏴‍☠️

The space that kernel allocated for the user process.

## Users 🏴‍☠️

A users is an entity that can run programs. Each user has a unique user ID (UID) and a unique group ID (GID). The user ID is used to identify the user and the group ID is used to identify the group of users.

Note: The root user has UID 0 and GID 0, and it is the only user that can run programs with root privileges which means that has access as administrator on traditional Unix systems. Operating as root can be dangerous. It can be difficult to identify and correct mistakes because the system will let you do anything
